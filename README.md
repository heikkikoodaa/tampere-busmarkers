This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

Simply put it's just a test project where I worked with React and React Leaflet and tried some API calls as well. I think it turned out ok for my first project and it shows city's buses locations in (almost) real time.

## Update

Changed things a little, like removing setInterval alltogether, because the data itself keeps changing and that change reflects to the map itself and updates the locations of the buses and trams.
